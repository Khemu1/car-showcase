# Car Showcase Project

## Overview
This project is a web application showcasing various cars. Users can view details about each car, including make, model, year, and other specifications. The application is built using Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. Car images use a placeholder as the IMAGIN.studio API integration did not work as intended.

## Features

  - Each car listing includes a placeholder image due to the IMAGIN.studio API integration not being implemented.
  
- **Search Functionality**
  - Users can search for cars by make and model criteria using a search bar.

- **Filters**
  - Filters available for year and type of fuel to refine search results.

- **Car Details**
  - Clicking on a car from the listings displays detailed information.
  - Details include specifications like engine type, transmission, fuel type, and more.
